## Signals in Angular 17

In Angular 17, signals are a new way to manage data reactivity. They act as wrappers around values, notifying the framework whenever the value changes. This allows for more efficient change detection and updates, refreshing only the parts of your application that actually need it.

Here's a quick breakdown:

#### Concept: Signals hold a value and signal changes to that value.
#### Benefits:
###### Improved performance: Only triggered updates for changed data.
###### Simpler code: Easier to track and manage changes.
#### Types:
###### Writable signals: Allow modifying the value.
###### Computed signals: Derived from other signals (read-only).

Overall, signals offer a powerful tool for building reactive Angular applications with better performance and cleaner code.
